## How to play the game:
First you are choosing the board size and country you want to play for, then with "Start Game" you can start the actual game.
Note: The bigger the board size, the more complicated it gets.
The two players decide who can start first. After each turn, the player passes his turn to the enemy. This continues until the game is finished.

### A turn
Each turn a player can choose one of the available rows. In the chosen row, he now can decide how many of the boxes he wants to "cross out". 
Please be aware: Once a row is chosen by tapping the first available box, he cannot undo his decision. Players have to tap at least tap one box each turn. The maximum amount is to 
tap all boxed in the chosen row.

### Game finish
The game is finished, when there are no more boxes left to tap at. Whoever is the last one to tap on the last reamining box, is the loser of the match.


## REST API
At the beginning you can choose the country that you want to play for. This list is extracted from an open api: https://api.first.org/data/v1/countries Every country from Asia and Africa is included.
